PinBallFrenzy ReadMe or what as you wish
This is an simple pinball game prototype I made while learning C++ language, so the code style is quite bad.
This little game use HGE 2d game engine and Box2D for physics simulation. You may find this two famous projects on Git.
Though the code style is bad, the game logic is straight forward, if you are also fresh in game making, I think this may still do some help.
For future improments, I may start over on this and code from zero. Or maybe not, why make a more enjoyable game then?
The repo's name OBOPinBall stands for Open Box2D Opengl Pin Ball, as you can see, no opengl involved in this project. Well I lied, U mad?
Actualy, I made a opengl2.0 based 2D game render for this game, and at first cocos2d-x is my first choice of making mini games.However, when I left my hometown,
and have my after gradute courses in BeiJing, I took only my lap top with me, and unfortunately, it's Dell 6400 with a video card of ATI1400x, which is
quite famous for even not suporting Opengl1.6, so it's impossible for me to write any pratical code using opengl on this machine.

All the graphic resources in this project was made by me, you can use them free as you wish if you want to.
So,if you like or realy hate this project, please tell me at lixuhit@gmail.com ,thank you.
